# Game-of-life V2
My own implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Typescript and HTML-CSS.
In this version you can dynamically create and play with multiple game of life's instances simultaneously.

Created jasmine tests to ensure the algorith is correct.

Download dependencies with with "npm install".
