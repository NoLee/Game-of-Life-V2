# Game-of-life V2
My own implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Typescript and HTML-CSS.
In this version you can dynamically create and play with multiple game of life's instances simultaneously.

Added jasmine tests to ensure the algorith is running correct.

Instructions:
- Download dependencies with with "npm install" (bootstrap and jquery)
- If you want to run in the browser (recommended), use a module bundler tool (like *browserify* or webpack) to bundle Typescript files into one Javascript file (bundle.js)
- If you want to run tests in the browser, do the same bundling process as above.
